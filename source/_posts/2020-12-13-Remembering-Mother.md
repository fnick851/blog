I was told that it is a tradition in my hometown to host a special ceremory for the mother's third death anniversary, preferably, by the son.

Well, at this time due to COVID and other issues, I won't be able to go back to China easily. My mother passed away three years ago on December the 13<sup>th</sup>. I am keeping her in my memory. The loss of her is something I do not get over with, which is fine.
