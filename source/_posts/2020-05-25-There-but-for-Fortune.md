To this world:

[A song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lFPIIdud9o) by Phil Ochs -

> show me a prison, show me a jail
> show me a prisoner whose face is growin' pale
> and I'll show you a young man with many reasons why
> and there but for fortune, may go you or I
>
> ---
>
> show me an alley, show me a train
> show me a hobo who sleeps out in the rain
> and I'll show you a young man with many reasons why
> and there but for fortune, may go you or I
>
> ---
>
> show me the whiskey stains on the floor
> show me a drunken man as he stumbles out the door
> and I'll show you a young man with many reasons why
> and there but for fortune, may go you or I
>
> ---
>
> show me the country where the bombs had to fall
> show me the ruins of the buildings once so tall
> and I'll show you a young land with so many reasons why
> and there but for fortune, may go you or I, or I
