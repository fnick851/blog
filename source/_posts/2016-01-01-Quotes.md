## Michelle Obama
> Everyone on Earth, they'd tell us, was carrying around an unseen history, and that alone deserved some tolerance.

## John Mayer
> Blues music is like embracing pain, but realizing life is worth putting up to.

## Charles Forsman, The End of the F\*\*\*ing World
> The problem with the person having a lack of love, is that they don’t know what it looks like. So it is easy for them to get tricked, to see things that aren’t there. But then I guess we all lie to ourselves all the time.

## 格纳齐诺，幸福，在幸福远去的时代
> 我告诫自己，你话说得太多，你听别人倾诉得太多，你咖啡喝得太多，你在陌生房间里坐的时间太长，你睡眠质量太差，你醒着的时间太长，你平庸的事想得太多，你希望过多，你安慰自己太频繁。
## Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet
> Do not believe that he who seeks to comfort you lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life has much difficulty and sadness and remains far behind yours. Were it otherwise he would never have been able to find those words.

> If your everyday life seems poor to you, do not accuse it; accuse yourself, tell yourself you are not poet enough to summon up its riches; since for the creator there is no poverty and no poor or unimportant place.​

> ...for fundamentally, and precisely in the deepest and most important things, we are unspeakably alone, and a great deal must happen in order that one man may be able to advise or even help another—a great deal must succeed, a whole constellation of things must be realized for it once to prosper.

## Others
> Human love affirmation. Unfailingly positive. Tremendous cheerleader. Give direct, unvarnished feedback.

> Best professional advice: don't be so polite.

> 让人觉得真实的自己被欣赏，能够做自己，展露本真的自我。不要试图影响和改变一个人。自己最了解什么最适合自己，真实自己的生活方式就是最好的生活方式。可以“充能”，但不要“塑形”。

> 思想感情不到位，话不要说。有些问题可能已经包含了一个期望中的答案，思考下再回答。自以为是的善意话语却可能对意想不到的听众有负面作用。言语均有其具体合适的对象。不要出口伤任何人，哪怕是面对亲密的人。沟通时，倾听不是告诉怎么做，不是高高在上，而是静静的听，站在一起。

> 发自内心的认可自己，自信，审视自己，先与自己相处好，再和他人相处。天行健，君子以自强不息；地势坤，君子以厚德载物。世上聪明之人不少，看得透彻之人也不少，但聪明人往往狷介有余，宽厚不足。如果被人告诉你，你所爱之物并没有意义，而且你还听取了他们的说法，那么你一定失去了部分自我。

> 拯救人类要通过爱与被爱。世界上一无所有的人只要有片刻时间思念爱人，那么他就可以领悟幸福的真谛。天使存在于无比美丽的永恒思念中。

> 任何可维持的长期关系的特征：舒服。

> 何谓成熟呢？就普通人而言，能不再以自我为中心，能理解别人的痛苦。而哲人的成熟，更在这之上。他们能对人生在世的难处和痛苦产生悲悯之心。从庸碌之人和乌合之众那里，看到坚韧又伟大的力量。

> 文章憎命达。

> Life’s too short for pretending you’re something you’re not. The truth is that video games are nerdy. They’re also beautiful.
